  - FoodData Central is an integrated data system that provides expanded 
nutrient profile data and links to related agricultural and experimental 
research.
  - The main dataset consist on the Foundation Foods. 
  - Foundation Foods includes values derived from analyses for food components,
including nutrients on a diverse range of foods and ingredients as well as 
extensive underlying metadata. These metadata include the number of samples, 
sampling location, date of collection, analytical approaches used, and if
appropriate, agricultural information such as genotype and production 
practices. The enhanced depth and transparency of Foundation Foods data can 
provide valuable insights into the many factors that influence variability 
in nutrient and food component profiles. The goal of Foundation Foods will be 
to, over time, expand the number of basic foods and ingredients and their 
underlying data. Foundation Foods provide extensive underlying metadata for 
each of its food items, which helps users recognize the potential variability 
of values across food components. For example, one food profile can represent 
hundreds of analyzed samples providing thousands of pieces of individual data 
about this food.
  - In simple terms, we are using the foundation foods with their corresponding 
ingredients. We match the information with the food categories as well. Then we
tag each of the products that are inside the same category as similar (1) and 
the complement (0). With this information we can make a 1 by 1 comparison of 
each product and determine the similarity. This information is complemented 
with the input of the food engineers.
